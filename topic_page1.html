                <h2>
                    The Domain Name System (DNS) 
                </h2>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 60px;">
                    The Domain Name System (DNS) is a fundamental technology that enables the internet to be accessible and easy to use. While computers and other devices
                    communicate using numerical IP addresses, these numbers are difficult for humans to remember. DNS solves this problem by converting readable
                    web addresses, such as www.coca-cola.com, into numerical IPs like 52.14.144.171, allowing users to navigate the web seamlessly.              
                    DNS was introduced in 1983 by Paul Mockapetris, and replaced the older HOSTS.TXT system, which became unmanageable as the number of connected devices
                    increased.
                </p>
                <h4 style="margin-bottom: 0;">Types of DNS Servers:</h4>
                <ul style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 60px;">
                    <li>
                        Recursive DNS Servers: A recursive DNS server is the part of the DNS system that does most of the work to find the answer to your domain lookup. 
                        When a website is typed into the browser, the device sends a request to a recursive server first. This server’s job is to track down the IP address
                        you need, even if it has to interact with other DNS servers along the way. They serve as the middleman a device and the global DNS infrastructure.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Authorative DNS Servers: An authoritative DNS server is the part of the DNS system that holds the official information about a domain such as GoDaddy. Thinking of 
                        DNS like a series of directories, the authoritative server is the one that owns the final, accurate record, and knows exactly which IP address a
                        domain should point to, as it stores the domain’s actual DNS data.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Caching and Forwarding DNS Servers: A caching DNS server’s main job is to save time and reduce network traffic by temporarily storing the answers it
                        receives from other DNS servers. When a user requests a domain’s IP address, the caching server checks if it already has the answer saved from a previous lookup, and if
                        it does, it can quickly respond without asking other servers again.
                        A forwarding DNS server acts like a middleman, passing DNS queries from clients to other DNS servers, usually outside the LAN. Instead of handling the full
                        lookup process itself, it sends the query on behalf of the client and returns the answer. They are often used by organizations to manage DNS traffic, add a
                        layer of control, and improve efficiency by directing queries to faster DNS servers.
                    </li>
                </ul>    
                <h4 style="margin-bottom: 0;">A DNS query typically involves four distinct server types to resolve a domain name into its corresponding IP address:</h4>
                <ul style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 60px;">
                    <li>
                        The device contacts a recursive resolver, usually provided by an Internet Service Provider. This resolver initiates the process by receiving the client’s request and forwarding it through the DNS hierarchy.
                        In essence its main job is to find IP addresses by contacting other DNS servers. Once it gets the query, it forwards questions to the other servers in the hierarchical order.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The resolver then queries root servers, which provide direction by identifying the appropriate top-level domain (TLD) nameserver. When the resolver asks for information, they don’t return the final IP
                        address. Instead, they respond with a list of TLD nameservers associated with the requested domain’s extension (such as .com, .org, or .net).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The TLD nameserver is next in line referring the resolver to the domain’s authoritative nameserver which holds the detailed records needed to complete the search.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The authoritative server, which hosts the definitive zone records for a domain returns the final correct IP address needed completing the process. Authoritative servers come in two forms: a primary server that
                        stores the original zone data and a secondary server that holds a duplicated copy to help balance traffic and provide redundancy if the primary server goes down. 
                        Together, these components enable structured, reliable name resolution across the internet.
                    </li>
                    
                </ul>
                <p>
                    This process happens in milliseconds and is repeated billions of times daily. DNS also manages many other records
                    like MX (email), CNAME (aliases), and TXT (authentication/security), making it essential for things such as browsing,
                     emailing, cloud services, and online security. DNS is the invisible framework that supports internet navigation,
                    ensuring fast, reliable, and structured access to the online world.
